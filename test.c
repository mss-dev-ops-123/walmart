C Language Overview
C is a general-purpose, procedural programming language developed in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs. It is widely used for system and application software due to its efficiency, flexibility, and control over system resources.

Key Features of C:
Low-Level Access:

Provides direct manipulation of memory and hardware, making it suitable for system programming like operating systems and embedded systems.
Efficiency:

C programs are fast and have minimal overhead, making it ideal for performance-critical applications.
Portability:

Code written in C can run on various platforms with minimal changes, making it highly portable.
Rich Standard Library:

C offers a wide range of built-in functions for tasks like I/O operations, memory management, string manipulation, etc.
Modularity:

Supports modular programming with functions, making code easier to manage and maintain.
Applications of C:
Operating Systems:

Most operating systems, like Linux, UNIX, and parts of Windows, are written in C.
Embedded Systems:

Used in microcontrollers, IoT devices, and hardware drivers.
Compilers & Interpreters:

Many programming language compilers, like Python and Java, have core components written in C.
Game Development:

Due to its speed, C is often used for developing game engines.
Database Systems:

Popular databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL are built in C.
Basic Syntax Example:
Hereâ€™s a simple C program that prints "Hello, World!":

c
Copy code
#inc
